## Introduction to Application

This is an app that is used to send alarms for bad air quality detected. it requires a bundled sensor device and connects the device via Bluetooth. The sensor device consists of MQ135 and DHT22 as sensors to sense temperature, humidity, VOCs, CO, Smoke. and ESP32-WROOM-32D is the sensor microcontroller.

Air Alarm has 3 pages upon entry. The first page is used to view the weighted overall score of the air. The second page is used to view the real-time data and to access the threshold page for each environmental data. Users can view the real time data and enter the threshold page for each environmental data. After entering the threshold page, users can see the reference thresholds and tick the stars for the thresholds users want to monitor. The third page is for the user to customize the Alarm trigger conditions. The first way is to set the minimum trigger threshold for the number of poor or bad statuses. The second method of notification is to monitor the status of your ticked stars. The third notification method is to set a threshold for the overall score.

When the app is launched in the background, the alarm can still be triggered.
